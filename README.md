# PhantomEye — Advanced Web-Based Media & Location Capture Framework

PhantomEye is a fully integrated and security-enhanced media + location capture framework designed for controlled environments, research, audits, and authorized testing. The system supports real-time camera feed capture, video chunk recording with automatic merging, precise geolocation acquisition, IP intelligence, and template-based front-end delivery — all managed through a unified Bash automation script.

This project is production-ready, fully verified, and includes a hardened backend, tunnel automation, and deployment-grade security guidelines.
